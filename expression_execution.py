#in python if we multiple the string with number than the string will printed the 
#number of times

#example
str='bholeram'
a=2
b=3
print(a*b*str)
c="2"
print((c+str)*b) #string concatination
#numeric values can operate with all arithemetic operators
print(9*5+9)
#expression with interger and float will always result float
print(9.0*7*7)

#result of devision of two number will always float

#result of integer devision of two number is integer and float but result give as float
print(8//9.0)
print(8/9.0)

#floor gives the closest lesser than integer value of float value
#integer division is the floor of the given value
#this means that the floor = integer devision in python
A,B=12,5
print(A//B) #2

#when the denominator is negative the remainder is negative
print(9%8) #1
print(-9%8) #1
print(9%-8) #-1
